name: Jupyter Server - compute on shared Jupyter node for exploration, debugging
category: Interactive Apps
subcategory: Servers
role: batch_connect
description: |
  This app will launch a [Jupyter] server session on a shared Jupyter node on the Berkeley Research Computing([BRC]) infrastructure. Use this app to launch notebooks for lightweight, short duration, interactive exploration and debugging of code and data (using a single CPU core and at most 2 GB memory). For long or compute-intensive jobs, please use the other Jupyter Server app to run in the compute partitions of the Savio cluster.
