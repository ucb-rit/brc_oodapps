# Batch Connect - BRC RStudio Server

An Batch Connect app that launches an RStudio server within a
batch job.

## Install

These are command line only installation directions.

We start by downloading a zipped package of this code. This allows us to start
with a fresh directory that has no git history as we will be building off of
this.

```sh
#Git Clone
git clone https://github.com/ucb-rit/brc_rstudio-compute_oodapp.git

# Change to this new directory
cd brc_rstudio-compute_oodapp
```

From here you will make any modifications to the code that you would like and
version your changes in your own repository:

```sh
#
# Make all your code changes while testing them in the OnDemand Dashboard
#
# ...
#

# Add the files to the Git repository
git add --all

# Commit the staged files to the Git repository
git commit -m "my changes"
```

## Contributing

1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
2. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
3. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
