name: RStudio Server - compute on shared OOD node for exploration, debugging
category: Interactive Apps
subcategory: Servers
role: batch_connect
description: |
  This app will launch an [RStudio] (an IDE for [R]) session on a shared OOD node on the Berkeley Research Computing ([BRC]) Savio cluster, using R 4.2.1. Use this app to launch RStudio sessions for lightweight, short duration, interactive exploration and debugging of code and data (using a small number of cores and at most 8 GB memory). For long or compute-intensive jobs, please use the other RStudio Server app to run in the compute partitions of the Savio cluster.
